                <h1>Privacy</h1>
                <span class="underline">Your privacy is very very serious to us.</span>
                <h4>Last Modified: January 14, 2013</h4>
                <p>This privacy policy, which was adapted from a policy originally provided by Automattic (WordPress.com), describes how the information we collect is treated when you visit and use our Website. Please read this notice very carefully.</p>
                <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                <p>Like most website operators, ROFLvid collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ROFLvid’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ROFLvid’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ROFLvid may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>ROFLvid also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. ROFLvid does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
                <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>Certain visitors to ROFLvid’s Website choose to interact with ROFLvid in ways that require ROFLvid to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ROFLvid gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors to login using Facebook or Twitter. In each case, ROFLvid collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ROFLvid. ROFLvid does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
                <p>ROFLvid may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Website. For instance, ROFLvid may monitor the most popular videos viewed, the amount of video shares on a users Facebook page or the amount of retweets of a certain video posted on twitter. ROFLvid may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ROFLvid does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>ROFLvid discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ROFLvid’s behalf or to provide services available at ROFLvid’s Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ROFLvid’s Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ROFLvid will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>
                <p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ROFLvid discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ROFLvid believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ROFLvid, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of ROFLvid and have supplied your email address, Facebook username or Twitter username ROFLvid may occasionally send you a notification to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ROFLvid and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of notification to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ROFLvid takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
                <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. ROFLvid uses cookies to help ROFLvid identify and track visitors, their usage of ROFLvid website, and their website access preferences. ROFLvid visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ROFLvid’s Website, with the drawback that certain features of ROFLvid’s Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
                <p>If ROFLvid, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that ROFLvid goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ROFLvid may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
                <h2>Ads</h2>
                <p>Ads appearing on any our Website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ROFLvid and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers</p>
                <h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
                <p>This privacy policy only applies to information collected by ROFLvid. This privacy policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ROFLvid does not own or control, or employees that ROFLvid does not manage. A ROFLvid website may contain links to a third party Website. Any information you provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any. We encourage you to read such privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the disclosure of your personally-identifying information, and ROFLvid and its affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your personally-identifying information by any third party.</p>
                <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, ROFLvid may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in ROFLvid’s sole discretion. ROFLvid encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
