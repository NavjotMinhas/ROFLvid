                <h2>ROFL Responsibly!</h2>
                <p>We exist so you can ROFL! We want you to enjoy you time by spending it watching the funniest videos on the internet.</p>

                <h2>You decide what is funny!</h2>
                <p>ROFLvid allows you to choose what truly makes you LOL! Whether you want to upload you personal home videos that have never been released to the public or embed a clip from your second favorite media site (us being the first), the users of ROFLvid get to vote on how ROFL-funny it actually is! To get started, create an account or sign in using Facebook or twitter.</p>

                <h2>We ONLY have videos</h2>
                <p>ROFLvid is and will only be videos. Pictures make you giggle, videos make you ROFL.</p>
                <p>Watch the most popular videos in our top ten trending block on the homepage or scroll lower to watch and vote on the next highly-ranked user-posted videos. The two tabs next to the homepage link allow you to watch viral videos, based on our viral algorithm and newly uploaded videos. You can also navigate through weekly and monthly archives in the navigation bar that pops up from the left side of the screen. </p>

                <h2>Why do you vote?</h2>
                <p>We gave you the control of deciding what is funny or not, but we needed to create an algorithm to rank what all of you think is funny. The most important factor of our very super-confidential algorithm is more LOL votes and less DNL votes.  We encourage you to use your powers to decide what you think is funny!</p>
